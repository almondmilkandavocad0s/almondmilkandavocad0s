# üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Glad you're here!

I am a hybrid **Computer Science professional** with a passion for developing data-driven products, with over a decade of experience. My expertise lies at the **intersection of data analysis, visualization, and software development**, where I leverage my skills to create impactful solutions that drive informed decision-making.

I currently work in Higher-Ed, where I create full-scale internal data products [like this one^*](https://analytics.unl.edu/){:target="_blank"}, to enrich teaching and learning and drive better academic outcomes at our institution. I also enjoy collaborating with my peers in my learning analytics work.

My journey has been shaped by a diverse range of experiences, from developing transformative software solutions in the insurance industry to mentoring and guiding students as a teaching assistant during my grad school. I have a **Master's degree in Computer Science** from the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I honed my skills in problem solving, academic reseach, and coding. I have contributed to research publications, and graduated with a Masters' Thesis, showcasing my commitment to advancing knowledge in the field.

I am committed to continuous learning and growth, always seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving field of data and AI.

Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring the fast-paced field of AI Engineering, with focussed interests in **Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics**. 

But, as a jack of many trades, my Github portfolio showcases a variety of projects that I dabble with in my personal time to stay on top of my career game.
