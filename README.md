# 🙋🏻‍♀️ Glad you're here!

I am a high-performing full-stack data product developer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and over 10 years of experience in end-to-end software solutions, _specializing in data product development_ over the last 6 years. My expertise lies at the powerful intersection of data analysis, data engineering, and software engineering, allowing me to build impactful solutions from the ground up.

My professional focus is in Higher Education, where I leverage data to drive student success. I have a proven track record of:

  * Architecting high-volume data marts and developing enterprise-scale learning analytics dashboards that serve entire campuses.

  * Building automation tools that have achieved up to 90% time savings.

  * Translating complex technical and analytical findings into clear, actionable insights for both executive leadership and daily end-users.

Currently, I am focused on building AI-Augmented Applications in Learning Analytics to directly drive improved student academic outcomes.

I hold a *Master's degree in Computer Science* from the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/), where I honed my skills through academic research and completing a [Master’s Thesis](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/computerscidiss/118/). I am continuously expanding my expertise in AI Engineering and (Educational) Data Mining to make era-relevant contributions to the field.
