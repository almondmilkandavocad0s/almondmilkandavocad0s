# 🙋🏻‍♀️ Glad you're here!

I'm a full-stack data product developer with over 10 years of software experience, and for the last 6 years, I've been deep in the world of data products. I've got a Master's in Computer Science from [UNL](https://www.unl.edu/) where I honed my skills through academic research and completing a [Master’s Thesis](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/computerscidiss/118/). But, what I really bring to the table is a *hybrid brain*: I speak data analysis, data science, data engineering, and software engineering, which lets me build robust, impactful solutions from scratch.

My current focus is in Higher Education, making sure data helps students win, and faculty and admins make data-informed decisions. I've been the one behind the scenes

   * Building voluminous data marts and use them by creating campus-wide learning analytics dashboards that stakeholders use

   * Taking complex technical findings and turning them into simple, actionable insights for everyone from senior-level execs to the daily end-user

My past life in software engineering also included whipping up automation tools that seriously saved time by increasing operational efficiencies for insurance account managers and service reps!

Right now, I'm channeling all that into my latest obsession: AI-Augmented Applications in Learning Analytics to directly boost student success. I'm always upskilling in AI Engineering and (Educational) Data Mining to stay on the cutting edge.

My GitHub is where I tinker, build, and explore. Check out the projects below!
